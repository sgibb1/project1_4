I am looking to buy a house. I really want this house to be PERFECT, if there's a single little thing wrong, I'm OUT!

Unfortunately, these real estate agents are too incompetent to find me a house that meets all the requirements, I'm sick of asking the same questions all the time! So I'd like you to build a bot that asks all the questions for me, and decides if the house is good/bad based on my needs. I know I can use Zillow or whatever but I don't trust these websites, I want my OWN bot! The bot must ask as if it was a very arrogant, impatient human, so if the agent input is invalid, call him an idiot and leave!

Must have:

3 bathrooms!
4 bedrooms!
2~4 chairs OR 2 sofas!
If there's chairs instead of sofas, must have a table!
Must be less than 10 miles from college!!
